# Marketing-data-analysis-and-Visualisation-for-Gambling-company-BWIN

This project is designed to provide marketing insights for the online gambling data collected by the collaborative Internet gambling research project between the Division on Addictions (DOA) and bwin Interactive Entertainment, AG (bwin), an Internet betting service.

The objective of othe project would be to provide some useful marketing insights from the datasets provided and create a data mart which can be used for further predictive analytics.

With each raw dataset,  variables to keep, drop, create were decided and ﬁnally merge with our ﬁnal basetable (marketing data mart). Then, once the ﬁnal basetable was complete, we also created a ﬁnal table for each of Internet sports betting, poker, casino, games, supertoto and general customer demographics, which were used to generate useful insights for every game in our R Shiny application.

The details on the variables created in the base table are present as a markdown document in this repository along with the R code for the same.
